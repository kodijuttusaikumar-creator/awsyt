Steps to Create an AWS Account
Step 1: Provide Root User Email and Account Name
Go to the AWS console webpage https://aws.amazon.com/console.
Enter your root user email address (the email ID you will use as the primary login for your AWS account).
Provide an account name (e.g., "My AWS Account"/ "Prod" / "UAT" / "Dev" / "Training").
Verify your email:
AWS will send a verification code to the provided email address.
Enter the code in the signup form to verify the email address.
Set up a strong password for your account to secure access.
Step 2: Provide Contact Information
Choose the account type:
Business (recommended for organizational use).
Personal (suitable for individual use or learning purposes).
Enter your contact information:
Full Name
Phone Number
Address
Country/Region
Step 3: Enter Billing Information
Provide valid credit or debit card information for payment verification.
Ensure the billing details match the account information (name and address) to avoid potential account suspension.
AWS will deduct a small amount for verification:
Example: ₹2 INR or $1 USD.
This amount will be refunded after validation.
Tip: Provide same name in step 2 and payment information.
Tip: make sure you enable International transaction.

Step 4: Confirm Identity
Select your country to confirm your location.
Upload a valid government-issued ID for identity verification:
PAN card, Voter ID, Driving License, or Passport (depending on the country).
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete this step.
Step 5: Confirm Phone Identity
Provide your phone number for contact verification.
Choose a verification method:
Text Message (SMS).
Phone Call (AWS will call you with a verification code).
Enter the verification code to confirm your phone number.
Step 6: Choose a Support Plan
Select a support plan based on your needs:
Basic Support Plan: Free of charge, suitable for most users and learners.
Developer, Business, or Enterprise Support plans are paid and provide additional features like 24/7 technical support.
Tip: Choose the Basic Support Plan initially to avoid additional costs.

Step 7: Log In to the AWS Management Console
Once your account is created, you will receive a confirmation email from AWS.
Go to the AWS Management Console.
Log in using your root user email address and password.
Root User
The Root User is the account owner who logs into AWS using the email address and password provided during the account creation process.

Key Points about the Root User:
The root user has unrestricted access to the AWS account.
It can perform critical actions such as:
Changing support plans.
Modifying payment methods.
Closing the AWS account.
Transferring the account ownership.
Security Tip: Secure the root user account by enabling MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) or two-factor authentication.
Why is there only one Root User?
Each AWS account is associated with a single root user because only one email ID can be used to create the account.
If you log in using this email ID, you are accessing the account as the root user.
IAM User (Identity and Access Management User)
IAM allows you to create users and groups and manage permissions for them within your AWS account.

Key Concepts:
IAM Users: Individuals who need access to AWS resources.
Groups: Logical grouping of users to manage permissions collectively.
Policies: JSON-based documents that define permissions for AWS services.
For example: The least privilege mechanism ensures users have only the permissions needed for their job duties and nothing more.
Why Create IAM Users?
Consider a scenario where two AWS administrators hire a junior employee to just monitor resources:

Junior resource may create/modify/delete resource, if we share root credentials.
Assign the ReadOnlyAccess policy to allow monitoring but restrict the ability to modify resources.
This follows the least privilege principle by granting only the permissions required for their role.
Should Root Credentials Be Shared?
No. Sharing root credentials is highly discouraged as it can compromise the entire AWS account. Instead, use IAM users with appropriate policies.

Roles and Permissions for IAM Users
Role	Responsibilities	Example Policy
AWS Administrator	Creates and manages AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, and databases.	AdministratorAccess policy
Developer	Limited access to specific resources, as required for development purposes.	Custom policies for resources
DBA	Manages databases, provides database access, and performs backup operations.	DBAdminAccess policy
Support Team	Monitors resources, identifies abnormalities, and alerts appropriate teams for resolution.	ReadOnlyAccess policy
Authentication and Authorization
Term	Definition
Authentication	Verifying identity using credentials such as a username and password.
Authorization	Defining what resources or actions a user is allowed to access after authentication.
Example of Authorization in Action:
A user logs in successfully but has limited permissions.
If the user attempts to perform an unauthorized action, AWS will respond with:
Error Message: "You are not authorized to perform this operation."
Common reasons: Permissions denied, not allowed to access certain resources, or lack of required policies.
Importance of Setting Up a Password Policy
Password Policy
Setting up a password policy is essential for maintaining the security of your AWS account. It ensures that IAM users create strong passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. A password policy typically enforces rules such as:

Minimum password length.
Inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
Password expiration and reuse restrictions.
How to Set Up a Password Policy:

Navigate to the IAM Dashboard.
Select Account Settings.
Click on Set Password Policy and configure the desired options.
How to Set Up an Account Alias
Navigate to the IAM Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
Scroll down to the Account Alias section.
Click Edit and enter a user-friendly name (e.g., mybusiness or cloudteam).
Save your changes.
Share the updated URL (https://<alias>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) with your IAM users for easier access.
Steps to Create an IAM User
Step 1: Enter User Details
Navigate to the IAM Dashboard and select Users.
Click Add User.
Enter a meaningful User Name (e.g., John.Doe or SupportUser).
Under Access Type, select AWS Management Console Access.
Choose I want to create an IAM user for accessing the console.
Enable Require users to create a new password at next sign-in to ensure the user sets a secure password.
Step 2: Set Permissions
Permissions define what resources the user can access and what actions they can perform.

Choose one of the following methods to assign permissions:

Add User to Group: Add the user to an existing group to inherit group permissions. For example:
A group with the S3FullAccess policy grants full access to Amazon S3.
Copy Permissions from an Existing User: Duplicate the permissions of another user with similar responsibilities.
Attach Policies Directly: Assign policies directly to the user. For example, attach the S3FullAccess policy to give the user full access to S3.
Tip: Assign permissions using the least privilege principle—grant only the permissions necessary for the user’s tasks.

Step 3: Review and Create
Review the user details, assigned permissions, and any attached policies.
If everything is correct, click Create User.
Download or copy the user credentials (username and temporary password) securely for the user to log in.
Understanding Policies in AWS
Policies:
Policies are JSON-formatted documents that define permissions on AWS services and resources. They control what actions an IAM user, group, or role can perform within the account.

Common Policies:
S3FullAccess: Grants the user full permissions to perform any operation on the S3 service.
IAMFullAccess: Grants full permissions to manage IAM users, groups, roles, and policies.
AdministratorAccess: Provides unrestricted access to all services and resources in the account (except account management).
An IAM user with this policy is equivalent to the root user but cannot manage the AWS account settings, such as billing or account closure.
IAM Permissions Model
Implicit Allow:
If a user is granted a policy like S3FullAccess, the user can access only the S3 service. All other services are implicitly denied.

Explicit Deny:
Deny overrides allow. For example, if a user is granted all-service access but explicitly denied S3 access, they cannot access S3.

AWS-Managed vs. Customer-Managed Policies
AWS-Managed Policies:
These are pre-defined by AWS and cater to common use cases. They include:

Service-based policies: Examples: AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.
Job-function policies: Examples: AdministratorAccess, PowerUserAccess, DatabaseAdministrator.
Limitations: These policies cannot be modified or deleted.
Customer-Managed Policies:
These are custom policies created by account administrators to meet specific business needs.

Policy Components
Policies are structured with the following key components:

Service: The AWS service the policy targets (e.g., s3).
Effect: The result of the policy, which can be either Allow or Deny.
Actions: The operations permitted or denied (e.g., s3:PutObject, ec2:StartInstances).
Resources: The specific resources the policy applies to (e.g., S3 buckets, EC2 instances).
Examples
Custom Policy: Allow Full Access to S3 and EC2 Services
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*",
        "ec2:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Custom Deny Policy for S3 Service
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Testing Deny Policies
Scenario:

Create an IAM user.
Assign the AdministratorAccess policy, granting unrestricted access.
Attach a custom DenyS3 policy to explicitly block S3 access.
Verification:

Attempt to access S3 resources.
Access will be denied, as explicit deny overrides allow, regardless of the AdministratorAccess policy.
Key Rule: Explicit Deny Precedence
If a permission is explicitly denied at any level—user, group, or resource—it will override any allow permissions. For instance:

If 100 actions are allowed and one is explicitly denied, the deny will take effect.
Inline Policies
An Inline Policy is directly embedded into a single user, group, or role.

When to Use Inline Policies:
In special cases where:
A user has reached the maximum number of managed policies (default is 20 per user).
There is a need to overcome policy size limits (6,144 characters per policy).
Key Characteristics of Inline Policies:
Not reusable: Inline policies are tied to a specific IAM entity and cannot be shared or reused with others.
Difficult to track: Since they are embedded, inline policies can be harder to audit compared to managed policies.
Best Practice: Use managed policies wherever possible for scalability, reusability, and easier maintenance.
How to Track IAM User Activities
You can monitor IAM user activities using the CloudTrail service:

What CloudTrail Does:
Logs all API calls and activities performed by IAM users, roles, and services.
Captures critical details such as:
Who made the request (user/role).
What action was performed.
When and where it happened.
Filtering Logs:
Use filters like username, event name, and time range to search for specific activities.
Default Behavior:
CloudTrail is enabled by default in all AWS accounts.
Retains activity logs for the last 90 days.
Best Practice:
For long-term retention, configure CloudTrail to send logs to an S3 bucket or integrate with CloudWatch Logs for deeper analysis.
How to Track User Last Login Information or MFA Status
To gather details about user account activity, download the Credentials Report:

Navigate to the IAM Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
Click on "Download Credentials Report".
This report provides:
Last login information: Tracks the most recent sign-in activity of each user.
User creation date: Indicates when the user was added to the account.
MFA status: Shows whether MFA is enabled or not.
Access key status: Displays the state of access keys (active/inactive).
Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) uniquely identifies AWS resources within your account.

Format:
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id.
Examples:
IAM user ARN: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/JohnDoe.
S3 bucket ARN: arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket.
Use Cases:
In policies to specify resources a user or service can access.
To track resources in logs and audits.
How to Track Resources Shared from Your AWS Account to Another AWS Account
Use the IAM Access Analyzer to identify and analyze shared resources:

Key Features:
External Access Analyzer: Detects resources shared externally (e.g., to other AWS accounts or public entities).
Unused Resource Analyzer: Identifies unused shared resources for better security and cost optimization.
Supported Resource Types: Includes S3 buckets, IAM roles, KMS keys, Lambda functions, and more.
Best Practice:
Regularly review shared resources to ensure compliance and avoid unintended access.
Permissions Boundary
A Permissions Boundary is an advanced IAM feature that defines the maximum allowable permissions for a user or role:

Purpose:
Acts as a guardrail to restrict the scope of permissions, even if additional policies are attached.
Use Case:
To enforce organizational security policies, such as limiting access for a contractor to specific AWS regions or resources.
Example:
A developer has a permissions boundary allowing only read-only access to S3 buckets, regardless of other policies granting broader permissions.
Best Practice:
Use permissions boundaries for specific, sensitive scenarios like compliance enforcement.
